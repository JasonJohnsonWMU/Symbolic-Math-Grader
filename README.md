### Project Description

##### TODO: Write some meaningful description here. Explain what the project is about, what it does, and how it works.

### Project Structure:

This repository contains four directories:

- `client/` - contains the source code for client side
  - The client is written in typescript and uses react as its framework
  -
- `server/` - contains the source code for server side
  - The server is written in C# and uses ASP.NET Core as its framework
  -
- `database/` - contains a script to create the database

  - The database is written in SQL and uses Microsoft SQL Server as its database engine (maybe, but anything newer than T-SQL 2005)
  - TODO: Add more details here

- `documentation/` - contains documentation on how an end user would use this product

### TODO: add more details here. Things to think about:

What coding standards are we using?
What are the dependencies? / What libraries and frameworks are we using?
What are the build instructions?
What are the test instructions?
What are the deployment instructions?
What is the name of this project/ product?
